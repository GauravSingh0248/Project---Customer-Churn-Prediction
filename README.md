# Project---Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning–based customer churn prediction system that identifies customers who are likely to leave a service or organization. The objective is to help businesses take proactive measures to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss by analyzing customer behavior and historical data.

The project follows an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied and compared to determine the most effective model for predicting churn.

Key Features --

Data cleaning and preprocessing of customer dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis to understand churn patterns

Feature selection and encoding techniques

Implementation and comparison of multiple ML models

Model evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Jupyter Notebook–based implementation for clear experimentation and analysis

Tech Stack

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Objective

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems by predicting customer churn and supporting data-driven decision making.
